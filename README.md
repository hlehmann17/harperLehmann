# HARPER

This is a GitLab/quarto-based template for the HARmonized Protocol Template to Enhance Reproducibility (HARPER) of Hypothesis Evaluating Real-World Evidence Studies on Treatment Effects: A Good Practices Report of a Joint ISPE/ISPOR Task Force (HARPER) protocol

## About

**Welcome to the quarto HARPER template!**

You can fork and use this template to quick-start your projects.

## How to use this template

This template is useful for real-world evidence (RWE) studies performed using the R or Python programming language. By forking the template, users can kickstart their analysis by having a Quarto-based HARPER document template (and corresponding table shells) along with pre-configured `.yml` files for continuous deployment of a project-specfic website using GitLab.

Step 1: Fork the repository and enter your project details (e.g. repository name, etc.)

Step 2: Remove the fork relationship under `Settings > General > Advanced >  Remove fork relationship`

Step 3: Execute `renv::restore()` to install all required dependencies (R packages) in the project-specific renv R package library.

Step 4: Enter/specify you project details in:

* README.md

* _quarto.yml

* .gitlab-ci.yml ([adjust the CI to your system if needed](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/getting_started/pages_forked_sample_project.html))

Step 5: Customize as much as needed and conduct great research!

## Repository details

This template is conceptualized for a typical RWE study with the following sub-directories/-files:

* `README.md`: Short description and information about the project. Could include background, aims/objectives, IRB/privacy information and details on repdroducibility

* `index.qmd`: Landing page of quarto website. Could include similar information as `README.md`

* `protocol`: HARPER quarto template (`protocol,qmd`) with empty table shells included in the protocol, template for study design figures and HARPER pdf template. It also contains a pre-configured `references.bib` BibTex file for citations/references one may want to include in the protocol.

* `documentation`: Sub-directory for documentation materials, e.g. data dictionaries or IRB approval letters.

* `scripts`: Sub-directory for R/Python analysis scripts. It is recommended to have a clear labeling such as: *1_data_query.qmd*, *2_descriptives.qmd*, *3_main_analysis*, *4_senstivity_analysis*, etc.

* `functions`: Custom R/Python functions to be sourced in analysis scripts.

* `results`: Sub-directory for collecting publication-ready tables, figures and other material relevant to communicate results.

* `public`: output directory for all quarto scripts and resources published on the website. This is particularly useful to publish annotated and interactive outputs along with a peer-reviewed manuscript as a measure of enhanced transpareny and reproducibility and a way to augment and support study results. The name of the output directory can be customized in the `_quarto.yml` file according to specific system needs (for more details see the [quarto webiste](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/quarto-projects.html)).

* `manuscript`: Sub-directory where manuscript and supplementary material can be drafted and stored.

* `renv`: Project-specific R package library. Fore more information, please visit the [renv website](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html).

* `.gitignore`: File to specify which files should not be tracked via git.

* `.Rprofile`: Environment file for R projects to store things like paths or keys (you can also setup an `.Renviron`)

* `_quarto.yml` and `.gitlab-ci.yml`: Global settings for Quarto and Gitlab CI/CD

Of course you can customize and remove/add other files and directories. For example, one may also want to add bash files to orchestrate the execution of different scripts.
